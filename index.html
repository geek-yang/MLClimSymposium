						Welcome to the symposium "Machine Learning in Meteorology and Climate"
					</p>
					<p>
						This symposium aims to present and discuss the current scientific applications of machine learning techniques within meteorology, oceanography and climate. Machine learning has been proven very useful when conventional techniques are difficult to apply, computationally expensive, or inaccurate. Although the applications of machine learning are very diverse, ranging from weather forecasting to classifying satellite images, they often have the same basic purpose: extracting relevant information from large quantities of data from observations and numerical models. This common ground provides potential for a valuable interdisciplinary exchange of ideas regarding the use of machine learning within each discipline.
